## Introduction

MoodWave is designed to enhance voice transformations, allowing users to modify the emotional characteristics of voice recordings. Whether you want to add excitement, calmness, or other emotions to your voice, MoodWave provides a customizable solution.

## Features

- Voice transformation with emotional characteristics
- Customizable emotional tones
- Easy-to-use interface for both training and inference

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MoodWave.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd MoodWave
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

- Follow the instructions in the [Usage Guide](docs/usage_guide.md) to get started with transforming voices using MoodWave.

## Model Architecture

MoodWave employs a transformer-based neural network architecture for voice transformation. The model consists of an encoder-decoder pair with attention mechanisms to capture sequential dependencies and emotional characteristics.

For more details, refer to [Model Architecture](docs/model_architecture.md).

## Training

To train the MoodWave model on your own dataset, follow the steps outlined in [Training Guide](docs/training_guide.md). Ensure that your dataset includes paired examples of input voice features and corresponding transformed voice features with emotion labels.

## Inference

After training, you can use the trained model for voice transformation. Refer to [Inference Guide](docs/inference_guide.md) for instructions on running inference with the pre-trained model or your own trained model.

## Dataset

MoodWave performs best when trained on a diverse dataset of voice recordings. If you'd like to contribute or use a pre-existing dataset, check the [Dataset Guide](docs/dataset_guide.md) for recommendations and guidelines.
