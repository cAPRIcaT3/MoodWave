# MoodWave Development Roadmap

## Step 1: Basic Voice Gender Transformation

### Goal:
Develop a basic Transformer model to transform a male voice input into a female voice.

### Tasks:
1. Implement a simple Transformer model with an encoder-decoder architecture.
2. Train the model using a dataset of paired examples with male voice recordings and corresponding transformed female voice recordings.
3. Evaluate the model's performance on a validation set.

### Notes:
- Use a small dataset for initial testing.
- Focus on the quality of gender transformation.

## Step 2: Voice Emotion Transformation

### Goal:
Extend the model to transform the emotional characteristics of the voice.

### Tasks:
1. Expand the dataset to include examples of different emotions in both male and female voices.
2. Modify the model to handle multiple emotions during training and inference.
3. Train the model to transform both gender and emotion.

### Notes:
- Ensure a diverse dataset covering a range of emotions.

## Step 3: User Interface Integration

### Goal:
Create a user interface for easy interaction and real-time voice transformation.

### Tasks:
1. Develop a simple user interface (UI) allowing users to input their voice and choose the desired gender and emotion.
2. Integrate the trained model into the UI for real-time voice transformation.
3. Add controls for adjusting the intensity of gender and emotion transformation.

### Notes:
- Prioritize user experience and accessibility.

## Step 4: Customizable Emotional Tones

### Goal:
Enhance MoodWave to allow users to customize emotional tones.

### Tasks:
1. Implement a mechanism for users to customize the intensity of different emotional characteristics (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger).
2. Update the UI to reflect customizable emotional tones.
3. Train the model to adapt to user-customized emotional transformations.

### Notes:
- Provide a balance between simplicity and customization.

## Step 5: Advanced Features and Fine-Tuning

### Goal:
Introduce advanced features and allow fine-tuning for specific use cases.

### Tasks:
1. Explore advanced transformer architectures for better voice transformation.
2. Implement features like voice modulation, pitch control, and speech rate adjustment.
3. Allow users to fine-tune the model based on their preferences.
