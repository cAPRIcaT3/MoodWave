# MoodWave: MFCC Integration

## Integration Details

MoodWave integrates Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) into its voice transformation process to enhance the model's ability to capture and modify emotional characteristics effectively.

### Role of MFCCs

In the MoodWave model architecture, MFCCs play a crucial role in representing the spectral features of voice recordings. Here's how the integration is designed:

1. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Input voice recordings are preprocessed to extract MFCCs, which represent the short-term power spectrum of the audio signal.
   - These coefficients provide a concise yet informative representation of the frequency content of the voice.

2. **Input to the Model:**
   - The extracted MFCCs serve as the input features to the transformer-based neural network employed by MoodWave.
   - The model uses the sequential dependencies captured by MFCCs to understand the emotional characteristics present in the voice signal.

3. **Customization of Emotional Tones:**
   - The use of MFCCs allows users to customize emotional tones effectively during the voice transformation process.
   - The model can focus on specific frequency components related to emotional expressiveness, providing a nuanced transformation.

### Training with MFCCs

To train the MoodWave model with your dataset:

1. Ensure your dataset includes paired examples of input voice recordings and corresponding transformed recordings, annotated with emotion labels.
2. Follow the steps outlined in the Training Guide, considering the integration of MFCCs in data preprocessing.

### Inference with MFCCs

After training, use the model for voice transformation:

1. Refer to the Inference Guide for instructions on running inference with the pre-trained model or your custom-trained model.
2. Input voice recordings with extracted MFCCs for personalized and emotion-enhanced transformations.
